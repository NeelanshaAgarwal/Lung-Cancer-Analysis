# Lung Cancer Analysis Web App

This is a Flask-based web application for lung cancer detection using machine learning. The application takes input via a web form, processes the data using a pre-trained machine learning model, and outputs the result of lung cancer prediction.


## Demo

You can try the deployed application here:

[**Lung Cancer Analysis App**](https://lung-cancer-analysis.onrender.com)


## Features

- **Web-based User Interface**: The app uses Flask and Bootstrap for a clean, responsive user interface.
- **Lung Cancer Detection Model**: The application uses a machine learning model (`lungcancer.pkl`) to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on the user's input.
- **Interactive Form**: Users can input their data through dropdown menus and submit it for analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **Flask**: Python web framework used for the backend.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used to load and run the prediction model.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework used for styling and layout.
- **Python**: The core programming language used for the backend.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lung-cancer-analysis.git
   cd lung-cancer-analysis
   ```


2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # For Windows, use: .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```


3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


4. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```


5. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to see the app in action.


## Files in the Repository

-`app.py`: The main Flask app that serves the web interface and handles the prediction logic.

-`lungcancer.pkl`: A pickled machine learning model used for predicting lung cancer.

-`templates/index.html`: HTML file for the main user interface.

-`static/`: Contains static files like CSS and JavaScript.

-`requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the app.

-`README.md`: This file.

## How It Works

1. The user accesses the app and fills out the form with relevant details.

2. Upon form submission, the data is processed, and the model predicts the likelihood of lung cancer.

3. The result is displayed on the same page, providing the user with feedback about their risk.

## Deployment

This app can be deployed to cloud platforms like [Render](https://render.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Simply push your code to your Git repository, connect it to your platform, and follow the instructions for deploying a Python web app.


## Deploying on Render

1. Create a Render account (if you don't have one).

2. Create a new Web Service and link it to your GitHub repository.

3. Make sure your `requirements.txt` file and `Procfile` are in the root of your project.

4. Choose the Python environment and deploy the app.

## Future Improvements

-Add more data features for better predictions.

-Implement more advanced ML models for improved accuracy.

-Add user authentication for personalized analysis and tracking.

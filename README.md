# Lung Cancer Analysis Web App

This is a Flask-based web application for lung cancer detection using machine learning. The application takes input via a web form, processes the data using a pre-trained machine learning model, and outputs the result of lung cancer prediction.

## Features

- **Web-based User Interface**: The app uses Flask and Bootstrap for a clean, responsive user interface.
- **Lung Cancer Detection Model**: The application uses a machine learning model (`lungcancer.pkl`) to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on the user's input.
- **Interactive Form**: Users can input their data through dropdown menus and submit it for analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **Flask**: Python web framework used for the backend.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used to load and run the prediction model.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework used for styling and layout.
- **Python**: The core programming language used for the backend.
